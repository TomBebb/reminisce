<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Linux (using joystick API or SDL)</li>
    <li>Windows (using XInput or SDL)</li>
    <li>Emscripten (when support arrives it should work out of the box)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Events for axis and button movement</li>
    <li>Every joystick can have its events processed internally into its state by
    using the StatefulJoystick API</li>
    <li>Iterator API for easy event detection</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
To add Reminisce to your Rust project, add the following to your Cargo.toml:
<pre><code class = "language-toml hljs ini">
[dependencies.reminisce]
git = "https://github.com/TomBebbington/reminisce"
</code></pre>

If you are using SDL, you should enable the SDL wrapper Reminisce has with the
following:

<pre><code class = "language-toml hljs ini">
features = [ "sdl" ]
</code></pre>
